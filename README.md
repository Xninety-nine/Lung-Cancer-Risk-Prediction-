## Overview

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess the risk of lung cancer in individuals based on various health and lifestyle factors. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide early detection insights, thereby facilitating timely medical interventions.

## Dataset
[Lung Cancer Risk Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/cancer-patients-and-air-pollution-a-new-link)

This dataset contains information on patients with lung cancer, including their age, gender, air pollution exposure, alcohol use, dust allergy, occupational hazards, genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking status, passive smoker status, chest pain, coughing of blood, fatigue levels , weight loss , shortness of breath , wheezing , swallowing difficulty , clubbing of finger nails , frequent colds , dry coughs , and snoring. By analyzing this data we can gain insight into what causes lung cancer and how best to treat it

# Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring relationship between features and using visualizations techniques to discover insights.
3. Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features to enhance model performance. 
4. Model Development: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict lung cancer risk levels (Low, Medium, High).
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and reliability using appropriate metrics.
